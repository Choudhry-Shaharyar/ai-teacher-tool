// Some example of questions you need the answers to are:
// -Bell schedule
// -Rosters/seating charts for each class
// -Notes about any potential problem students/classes so I have a bit of a heads-up
// -Let me know if there are aides in the class with me at any point so I'm not surprised when other random adults show up
// -If your lesson plan involves any sort of technology, EXPLAIN HOW TO USE IT, don't assume I already know
// -Emergency info. Also, if you know of any drills happening the day I am there, tell me
// -And please, tell me where a bathroom is for adults and not children, as well as a faculty room/planning room/whatever your school calls it
